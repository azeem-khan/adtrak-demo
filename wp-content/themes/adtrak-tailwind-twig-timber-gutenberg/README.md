# Boilerplate

See the boilerplate README: https://github.com/adtrak-core/boilerplate

## Gutenberg Theme

### Blocks

Blocks are the foundation of the content on your website. They have replaced Flexible Content with ACF. Any block that you want to be able to add to the page should be created in `_blocks`.

For more info, see https://palmiak.github.io/timber-acf-wp-blocks/

To create a new block, here is the quick rundown;

- Create a new twig file inside `_views/_blocks/` for "your-block.twig"
- Use the below code to generate your block

```
{#
  Title: BlockName
  Description: Description of BlockName
  Category: formatting
  Icon: dashicon
  Keywords: key words
  Mode: edit
  SupportsAlign: center
  SupportsMode: false
  SupportsMultiple: true
#}
```

- In WordPress admin, go to ACF, create a new Field Group called "Block: Your Block"
- Assign your custom fields, and under "Show this field group if" choose "Block" and then "Your Block"
- Add the new block via the Gutenberg editor on your page
- Code your block as as per normal, using

```
{{ fields.field_name }}
```

## Site Options

Default Site Options generated by PHP have been removed, and instead the boilerplate repo holds the exported JSON file that you can import. This will allow you to edit it.
